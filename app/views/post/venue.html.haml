The Information Science Department of the college has accepted our proposal to coorganize the camp. Please note that even though the college is in heart of the city, we expect all participants to stay at hostels provided at the venue. This is important for us to start on-time daily and also so that we can utilize the time in the evening to do many activities. We hope to keep you completely busy through out the 9 days."
